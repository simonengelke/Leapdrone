Leapdrone
=========

Quadcopter controlled with Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) remote and Arduino Uno.

By exploiting a loophole in how the control signal is transmitted to a normally closed-end drone system, we were able to hijack the frequency ultimately received by our drone and control it however we wished. Having found a vulnerability ubiquitous in modern RC controllers, we did the only logical thing we could think of: relinquish control to what was designed to be a gaming peripheral.
